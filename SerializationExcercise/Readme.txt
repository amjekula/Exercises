I removed the main method from the exercise and created a test case in order
to run the program. In my understanding, it is not a best practice test a program
link this using the main method.

Instructions to run or test the program:
1. go to ...\SerializationExcercise\SerializationExercises\test\exercise\data\test\SerializationTest.java
2. execute the test case by clicking:
	2.1 Alt+F6 on windows machine.
	2.2 Run >> Test Project (SerializationExercises)
