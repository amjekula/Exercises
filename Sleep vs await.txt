What is the output of the program below? Explain your answer.

The output of the program is 0. Because on sleep, the program becomes not runnable
for 1000 miliseconds and does not execute the ThreadB. Therefore, leaving the
output to be it's initial value which is 0.

Also, would the answer change if we were to replace: sleep(1000); with b.wait(); 
? Why or why not?

Replacing sleep(1000) with b.wait(); changes the output from 0 to 100 at this 
program because when the function wait is called, the program locks the current
thread and implement ThreadB. It only continues to implement ThreadExcercise where
it stopped after ThreadB has completely ran.
